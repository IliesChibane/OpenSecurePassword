## Project description

Ensuring the security of our personal information is paramount and one of the most effective ways to increase the security of our data and to have increasingly complex and diverse passwords. But having a multitude of complex and different passwords is far from easy, and it is easy to get lost and confused.
This is where password managers come into play, allowing easy and pragmatic password management securely. However, the majority of password managers host their data in the cloud and therefore are targeted by malicious people and therefore there is a real risk in using them.
This is where OpenSecurePassword comes in makes all the difference, using a local database limits the risk of being attacked as it involves accessing your own computer. And in order to increase the security an encryption system is used before being stored in the database and finally the software being open source this allows an improvement of its security.
Using a simple and intuitive interface, you will be able to manage your place words with ease.
